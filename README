agent - auto register - first launch, if no registratrion, register
  agent works for itself and sends data to manager (or relay)
  agent delivers its own SNMP to manager
probe - agent and probe can run together, probe scans network, gathers SNMP and delivers to manager
  each SNMP device must have its own registration
  if a probe finds an agent, ignore it
relay - middle man between agent and manager (do this?)
manager - if registration not claimed wthin X time, purge
